## Postduino Video Script
### v0.0001

[**steve and ian waving**]

Hi - I'm Steve, and I'm Ian - this is Postduino.

[**postduino print out, pile of bits, and flashy led toy**]

Postduino is an electronics subscription service that's all about helping you get the most out of Arduinos and similar microcontroller boards.

[**component illustration - with layering on annotations and how to type text**]

Each issue we send you a bunch of components, and some great looking, really detailed guides to their operation. 

[**printed guide, blogpost on a screen, podcast on an iphone, youtube on another screen**]

We include project builds to make them do interesting things, 

and ideas for how to push things further.

[**quick timelapse of that thing being built**]

We're also doing a podcast, and youtube project walkthroughs, 

so it's not all reading. 

All for just ten bucks a month.

[**another project blinking / spinning**]

You'll get straight to the fun stuff, but we'll ensure you learn the important concepts and details as you go.

[**mr flashy face**]

So you'll quickly break free of the instructions and start making things of your own. 

[**bag of LEDs being tipped out**]

We even send you spares 

and squeeze in extra components where we can to ensure you don't run out of options.

[**wee lad soldering**]

Postduino is for everyone, if you've never even touched a resistor, 

or if you tinker all the time and just want some new inspiration.

We're keeping everything one hundred percent potty chops free. 

So it's a great way to introduce your kids to electronics and coding, 

especially if you've never done it yourself.

[**one wifi shield = 40 components including a couple of RF thingies?**]

By using basic components, rather than those 'easy to use' preconfigured boards / shields, you learn real electronics - 

and we keep the costs right down. 

You have more scope to make cool things, as you have more components, and a better understanding of how they work.

[**flour and dough tube**]

(it's like we send you flour, yeast and water and a whole bunch of detailed recipes for amazing breads - instead of sending you a tube of pilsbury dough)

[**another description build up animation**]

Because we ship the parts AND the guides we know exactly the spec of the parts you are using, so we can be super-specific. 

So you shouldn't end up staring at a diagram muttering "everything is right, why isn't this working?" just because you got the 4455 instead of the 4456 by mistake.

[**flip to blogpost with embedded code**]

You can pick up the example Arduino code knowing that it was written for exactly the parts we shipped, and we can give you clues as to how to make the part do more.

[**some slack/twitter chatter around pin outs?**]

What's more - everyone that gets Postduino is working with the same parts at the same time - so you have a larger network of people to share ideas with, and to help you with troubleshooting.

[**just some amazing project - we both need to do some timelapse builds**]

We think this will save you hours of hunting for documentation, and allow you to spend more time creating more awesome projects.

Each issue in our first run is themed, and all the parts can be used together, building to some substantial projects. 

You'll receive the parts direct from our supplier in China. 

This cuts costs, meaning you get more components for your money. Meaning we can plan more ambitious projects. 

[**leds / led traffic lights**]

Issue One - Light

You'll learn how to make light, how to detect light, how to communicate with light, how to write with light, how to change colours, the options are endless. 

We've got 47 components in this pack - so even if you fry a couple you'll be able to create a bunch of great projects.

[**wire buzz game / digi bat with light up eyes**]

Issue Two - Sound

Continuing with the senses, this is a noisy one. 

Echolocation, making beeps buzzes and bangs, hearing things and even saying things.  

[**cardboard robot zipping past**]

Issue Three - Move it

Let's get mobile. A robot isn't a robot unless it moves, right? We'll get things moving.

[**tricorder with led and 7segs / numbers in console?**]

Issue Four - Elements

The components in this issue are all tuned to our world. If it can be detected or emitted you'll be detecting and emitting it!

[**weather station? / RC thing? / datalogger / plotly charts**]

Issue Five - Data and comms

This is the issue where we go all Internet of Things. We've gathered a lot of data so far, but we haven't captured it and we haven't sent it to the cloud. We fix that here.  

[**big ? / covered up blinky led thing under a teatowel?**]

Issue Six - Secret 

We can't give away the end of season suprises! You'll just have to wait. You'll get a bigger than usual pile of bits though.

By the end of season one you'll have everything you need

all the bits and all the knowledge

to join the megabuild where we combine everything into ... 

well that would be telling!

[**growing box of bits - stop motion style - STARTER KIT**]

Now - we're assuming you'll have bought some arduino starter kit at some point, played with it for an hour, and left it at the back of your desk or in a drawer.

If you don't already have an arduino please select one of the '+starter kit' rewards and your first issue will include everything you need to get started. 

For an extra twenty bucks you'll get a couple of arduino boards, jumpers, breadboards, pots, resistors, buttons, cables

 and all the other basics you'll need to get started - as well as the regular issue one parts.

So

why a subscription thing?

We love subscription services, and we don't have much free time. 

Who doesn't love getting a regular bundle of new toys to play with. 

[**little brown package**]

The fun of receiving another tiny eBay package from China that you forgot you ordered never gets old - 

and it can give you that little nudge to pick up the breadboard again and finally finish that cheesecopter project. 

[**dairylea tub with propellors**]

We hope Postduino will give all subscribers that little boost to their day every now and again. 

Also - we'd subscribe to this if it existed, but it doesn't, so we have no option but to make it. 

[**steve and ian wave again**]

Thanks for backing Postduino! 

We look forward to sending you stuff and seeing what you build.
