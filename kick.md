Postduino - monthly arduino project inspiration
 
Postduino is an electronics subscription service that's all about helping you get the most out of Arduinos and similar microcontroller boards.

Each issue is themed around a topic, and we send you a bundle of step by step beginners guides, walk through videos, and project ideas. We also ship you the components to make them.
 
We're also doing a podcast, and youtube project walkthroughs, so it's not all reading. This gives us space to go into some of the more interesting parts of electonics that are often skipped over in beginners guides.

You'll get straight to the fun stuff, but we'll ensure you learn the important concepts and details as you go. 

So you'll quickly break free of the instructions and start making things of your own.  

We even send you some spares and squeeze in extra components where we can to ensure you don't run out of options.

The hype around the internet of things should really be around the accessibility of electronics. There has never been a better time to tinker with electrons, especially if you have kids.

We're keeping everything one hundred percent potty chops free. So Postduino is a great way to introduce your kids to electronics and coding, especially if you've never done it yourself.
 
By using basic components, rather than those 'easy to use' preconfigured boards / shields, you learn real electronics and we keep the costs right down. You have more scope to make cool things, as you have more components, and a better understanding of how they work.

Because we ship the parts that the guides were written around we know exactly the spec of the parts you are using, so we can be super-specific. 

So you shouldn't end up staring at a diagram muttering "everything is right, why isn't this working?" just because you got the 4455 instead of the 4456 by mistake. 

You can pick up the example Arduino code knowing that it was written for exactly the parts we shipped, and we can give you clues as to how to make the part do more. 

What's more - everyone that gets Postduino is working with the same parts at the same time - so you have a larger network of people to share ideas with, and to help you with troubleshooting.
 
We think this will save you hours of hunting for documentation, and allow you to spend more time creating more awesome projects.

Season One

Each issue in our first run is themed, and all the parts can be used together, building to some substantial projects. We email you with links to all the material that makes up issue one - some of which is immediately public, some is on our secret subscriber channel.

You'll receive the parts direct from our supplier in China. This cuts costs, meaning you get more components for your money. Meaning we can plan more ambitious projects. 

[ Issue One - Light ]

You'll learn how to make light, how to detect light, how to communicate with light, how to write with light, how to change colours, the options are endless. 

We've got 47 components in this pack - so even if you fry a couple you'll be able to create a bunch of great projects.

[ Issue Two - Sound ]

Continuing with the senses, this is a noisy one. 

Echolocation, making beeps buzzes and bangs, hearing things and even saying things.   

[ Issue Three - Move it ]

Let's get mobile. A robot isn't a robot unless it moves, right? We'll get things moving. 

[ Issue Four - Elements ]

The components in this issue are all tuned to our world. If it can be detected or emitted you'll be detecting and emitting it!

[ Issue Five - Data and comms ]

This is the issue where we go all Internet of Things. We've gathered a lot of data so far, but we haven't captured it and we haven't sent it to the cloud. We fix that here.  
 
[ Issue Six - ??? ] 

We can't give away the end of season suprises! You'll just have to wait. You'll get a bigger than usual pile of bits though.

By the end of season one you'll have everything you need all the bits and all the knowledge to join the megabuild where we combine everything into ... well that would be telling!
  
Now - we're assuming you'll have bought some arduino starter kit at some point, played with it for an hour, and left it at the back of your desk or in a drawer.

WITH STARTER KIT

If you don't already have any arduino kit at all please select one of the '+starter kit' rewards and your first issue will include everything you need to get started. 

For little extra you'll get a couple of arduino boards, some jumpers, breadboards, pots, resistors, buttons, cables and all the other basics you'll need to get started - as well as the regular season one parts.


Risks 

We've already written most of the material for issue one. Later issues will be written once we have been funded. Season one aims to release monthly, but will follow a 'released when it's ready' principle.

We're shipping components in multiple batches, and are reliant on the postal service to ensure they arrive. From my previous kickstarter I know that a small percentage of kit won't get through. We've accounted for shipping replacements when needed.

So why a subscription thing? We love subscription services. Who doesn't love getting a regular bundle of new toys to play with. 
 
The fun of receiving another tiny eBay package that you forgot you ordered never gets old - and it can give you that little nudge to pick up the breadboard again and finally finish that cheesecopter project.  

We hope Postduino will give all subscribers that little boost to their day every now and again.
