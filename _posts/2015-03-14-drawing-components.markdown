One thing that really bugged me when I bought my first Arduino starter kit was the poor quality of the documentation.

It reminded me of the 30th generation photocopied worksheets we occassionally got handed at university. You could tell it was an 'e' by a process of elimination, but wow it didn't make anything easy or fun. Especially in physics when every letter **kind of mattered**.

So for Postduino we decided to set the bar a little higher and do some fresh illustration work for all our how-to and component guides.

Here are some early drafts, do let us know what you think [over on the twitters](http://twitter.com/postduino).

All of our guides and docs will be digital - so we don't need to keep things mono - which we thought we should embrace.

The more complicated components look awesome, but even the really simple stuff like the humble photoresistor can be made to look imposing if you just draw it big enough.

By having full control over the illustrations it's helping us to explain how things work in a much more visual, direct manner.

Photographs are great, video is better in some cases, but illustrations can do things that neither of those can. We're playing around with the best way to use the drawings to explain concepts. 

Which do you prefer of these two LED options? [We'd love to know](http://twitter.com/postduino)
