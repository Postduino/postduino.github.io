One of the most fun parts of getting Postduino ready to roll is testing that the parts we want to include are reliable, do what they say, and that we fully understand how they work.

This means a steady flow of jiffy bags dropping through our letter boxes, packed with lovely components.

Part of the ethos behind Postduino is that we want to use the most basic component we can to get the job done. 

We think this gives a better understanding of what's going on, and allows you to make the decision later to use an 'easier' component with more knowledge of the implications.

Parts like the humble photoresistor. Instead of getting a single "light sensor board" we can include a bag of twenty photoresistors in issue one.

Why would you need twenty photoresistors?

I've been playing with these a lot for the past couple of days. I'm experimenting with using an array of photoresistors in different orientations and arrangements. 

Combined with a small array of RGB LEDs, a shift register and some arduino code, these photoresistor arrays are surprisingly good fun to play with. Half puzzle, half yo-yo like distraction / stress toy.

Issue one is themed around light, so I'm pretty sure this project will make it in there.
